# National-Flight-Dataset
We crawled 98,158 flight records from WebXml [http://www.webxml.com.cn/webservices] as the large-scale dataset. This dataset covers 52 different airplane types from 29 Chinese airlines.

Each file in the dataset represents flights of the same airplane type, with nodes containing fields as: `"AIRLINE_CODE"`, `"FLIGHT_ID"`, `"DEPARTURE_AIRPORT"`, `"ARRIVAL_AIRPORT"`, `"TIME_DEPARTURE"`, `"TIME_ARRIVAL"`, `"CITY_DEPARTURE"`, `"CITY_ARRIVAL"`, and `"MODE"`.
